Officially created repository for project.

Much prep work has been done up to this point, but now the time has come to start writing. Since I do not have all the hardware components yet, work must begin on
the software end. Senior seminar began in early September. September was spent brainstorming and refining ideas. In early October, everyone in class met with the
professor to finalize their project and to begin writeups. Writeups have had their second drafts turned in, and others have started their projects. Also, the
professor is getting ready to turn up the heat on anyone who does not start soon.

Technically, I "have" experience in writing Android apps, but it was for a class and I did not do as well as I could have, so the whole project will be a learning 
experience.

I have set daily reminders (and accidentally two for Wednesdays) to work on thesis, so I will adhere to them, because saying that I hope I will adhere implies that
I might not, so let's just say I will.

Semester goal: Pi is collecting data on all sensors and can send information to mobile app. Mobile app can remind user of something, but this is a notification that
will always occur.

Week goals: 1. Draft how the mobile app will run, including potential class diagrams
2. Get a notification working with a preprogrammed notification time.
